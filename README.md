# Awesome Federated Learning

A curated list of materials for federated learning, including blogs, surveys, research papers, and projects. You are very welcome to star it and create a pull request to update it.

Federated learning (FL) is attracting considerable attention these years. We organize these materials for you to learn federated learning and further facilitate your research and projects. 

We organize the papers by [research areas](#paper-by-research-area) for challenges in FL and by [conferences and journals](#paper-by-conference-and-journal). 

ðŸ’¡ We are thrilled to open-source our federated learning platform, [EasyFL](https://github.com/EasyFL-AI/EasyFL), to enable users with various levels of expertise to experiment and prototype FL applications with little/no coding. It is based on our years of research and we have used it to publish numerous papers in top-tier conferences and journals. You can also use it to get started with federated learning and implement your projects.
